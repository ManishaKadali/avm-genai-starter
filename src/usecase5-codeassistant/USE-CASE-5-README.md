# Use Case 5 : Code Assistant Bot

**Overview:**
The objective of this challenge is to create a code assistant

**Resources:**
Documentation for the LLM API.
Source code of the initial application.
Example code assistant.

**Input:**
Your application should accept blocks of code and help a developer with the following tasks
1. Code Comments
2. Code Translation (One language to Another)



**Functionality:**
API Integration: Integrate with the provided LLM API to send requests and receive responses. 
Output Results: The application should output long form content but that is highly tailored and accurate because you have used multishot prompting and COT

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Functionality: Does the application accurately generate content with the LLM API as expected?
Innovation: How creatively does the solution use the LLM's responses to add value beyond the basic status information?
Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, documented, and easy to read?

**Submission Requirements:**
Source code for your application.
A brief documentation explaining how to set up and use your application.
Where would you take this type of functionality.
